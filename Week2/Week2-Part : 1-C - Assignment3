Assignment3:
Version Control with GitBranching: Create a new branch in your Git repository called "feature-branch." Make changes to a file in this branch and commit them. Provide a screenshot of the branch creation and commit process.Merging: Merge the "feature-branch" into the main branch. Explain the merge process and resolve any conflicts if they occur.

### Branching

1. **Create a New Branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```

2. **Make Changes to a File and Commit:**
   ```bash
   echo "Some changes" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Made changes in feature-branch"
   ```

### Merging

1. **Merge the Branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature-branch
   ```

2. **Explain the Merge Process:**

   - **Checkout Main Branch:** Switch to the main branch using `git checkout main`.
   - **Merge Feature Branch:** Use `git merge feature-branch` to merge changes from the feature-branch into the main branch.
   - **Resolve Conflicts:** If there are conflicts, Git will prompt you to resolve them. Open the conflicted files, resolve the conflicts, stage the changes, and commit the resolution.

3. **Resolve Conflicts (if any):**
   - Open the conflicted file(s) in a text editor.
   - Resolve the conflicts by choosing the appropriate changes.
   - Stage and commit the resolved changes:
     ```bash
     git add <resolved-file>
     git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
     ```
