### Explanation of the Collaborative Process

The collaborative process involves the following steps:

- **Forking:** Your collaborator forks (copies) your repository to their own GitHub account. This allows them to work on their copy without affecting the original repository.
- **Cloning:** They clone their forked repository to their local machine to make changes.
- **Changes and Commits:** After making changes, they commit these changes to their local repository and push them to their forked repository on GitHub.
- **Pull Request:** They create a pull request from their forked repository to the original repository. This notifies you of the proposed changes.
- **Review and Merge:** You review the pull request and merge it if the changes are acceptable. This incorporates the changes into the original repository, completing the collaborative workflow.
