Assignment4:Virtual Environment Setup.Explain the concept of a virtual environmentin Python.
Why is it important, especially in data science projects?
Create a virtual environment named "ml_env" using the venv module (for Python 3.3 and later). Activate the virtual environment and install a Python library of your choice (e.g., NumPy) within this environment. Write a Python script that imports the library and performs a basic operation (e.g., creating an array or matrix)

### Virtual Environment Setup in Python

#### Concept of a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment in Python is an isolated environment that allows you to run and manage multiple projects with different dependencies and package versions on the same machine. Each virtual environment has its own Python interpreter, libraries, and scripts, independent of the system-wide Python installation. This isolation ensures that dependencies from one project do not interfere with those of another.

#### Importance in Data Science Projects

Virtual environments are especially important in data science projects for several reasons:

1. **Dependency Management**: Different data science projects may require different versions of the same libraries. Virtual environments allow you to maintain these dependencies separately without conflicts.

2. **Reproducibility**: Using virtual environments helps in creating reproducible environments for data analysis and machine learning experiments. This is crucial for sharing your work with others or deploying it to different systems.

3. **Isolation**: Virtual environments isolate your project’s dependencies from the system’s global Python environment, preventing version clashes and ensuring that your project remains consistent across different development and production environments.

#### Creating and Using a Virtual Environment

Here’s how to create and use a virtual environment named "ml_env" using the `venv` module, and then install a library (e.g., NumPy) within this environment.

1. **Create the Virtual Environment**

   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Run the following command to create a virtual environment named `ml_env`:
   ```sh
   python -m venv ml_env
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - On **Windows**:
     ```sh
     ml_env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **macOS/Linux**:
     ```sh
     source ml_env/bin/activate
     ```

   After activation, your terminal prompt will change to indicate that the virtual environment is active.

3. **Install a Python Library (NumPy)**

   With the virtual environment activated, install NumPy using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy
   ```

4. **Write a Python Script**

   Create a Python script named `basic_operation.py` that imports NumPy and performs a basic operation, such as creating an array.

   ```python
   import numpy as np

   # Create a 1D array
   array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
   print("Array:", array)

   # Perform a basic operation
   print("Sum of array elements:", np.sum(array))
   ```

5. **Run the Python Script**

   Ensure the virtual environment is still activated, and then run the script:
   ```sh
   python basic_operation.py
   ```

   The output should be:
   ```
   Array: [1 2 3 4 5]
   Sum of array elements: 15
   ```
